Title: A Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC)
   Lead: A new clinical trial, titled "A Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC)," is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of combining zabadinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, with nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, in treating advanced metastatic microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). This trial is unique as it aims to explore the potential synergistic action of these drugs in enhancing tumor immunogenicity and sensitizing MSS CRC to PD-1 blockade. The study, which began enrollment in January 2021, is expected to last several years, and updates on its progress or results can be found on ClinicalTrials.gov using the link <https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04597863>.

# Preclinical Data and Early-Phase Trials

Preclinical data and early-phase trials have suggested that zabadinostat (CXD101), a class I/II histone deacetylase inhibitor, may enhance tumor immunogenicity and sensitize microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) to PD-1 blockade . This potential synergy between zabadinostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors could provide a promising strategy for treating MSS CRC, which remains resistant to traditional treatments.
The rationale behind this combination stems from the role of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in regulating gene expression, particularly in the context of tumor immunogenicity. HDAC inhibitors, such as zabadinostat, can induce histone acetylation, leading to changes in chromatin structure that promote the accessibility of immune cells to tumor antigens . By enhancing tumor immunogenicity, HDAC inhibitors may make cancer cells more susceptible to recognition and elimination by the immune system.
In preclinical studies, zabadinostat has been shown to increase the expression of tumor-associated antigens and induce an inflammatory microenvironment conducive to T cell infiltration . Moreover, the combination of zabadinostat with anti-PD-1 therapy has demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor effects in various preclinical models of CRC . These observations suggest that the synergistic interaction between HDAC inhibition and PD-1 blockade could be exploited to improve therapeutic outcomes for patients with MSS CRC.
In early-phase clinical trials, the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of zabadinostat in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy have been evaluated in various cancer types, including CRC . These studies have provided a foundation for further investigation into the potential benefits of this combination strategy in MSS CRC. The ongoing Phase II trial (CXD101-NIVO-CRC) aims to build upon these preclinical and early-phase findings by evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of zabadinostat plus nivolumab in patients with metastatic MSS CRC who have progressed on at least two prior lines of systemic therapy . The results of this trial could provide valuable insights into the utility of this combination strategy for the treatment of MSS CRC.

# Preclinical Evidence Suggesting Synergistic Effects of Zabadinostat and Nivolumab in MSS CRC Treatment

Preclinical data have suggested a potential synergy between zabadinostat (CXD101) and nivolumab in the treatment of metastatic microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) . This synergistic effect is attributed to the combined immunogenicity enhancement and tumor sensitization properties of both agents.
Zabadinostat, a class I/II histone deacetylase inhibitor, has been found to promote the release of neoantigens by increasing histone acetylation . This increased histone acetylation leads to an enhanced presentation of tumor-associated antigens to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby augmenting the immune response against cancer cells.
On the other hand, nivolumab is a PD-1 blocking antibody that inhibits the immunosuppressive effects of programmed death-1 (PD-1) on activated T cells . By blocking PD-1, nivolumab allows CTLs to effectively attack and destroy cancer cells. The combination of zabadinostat and nivolumab could potentially maximize the benefits of both agents by enhancing tumor immunogenicity (through zabadinostat) and reducing immune suppression (through nivolumab).
Moreover, preclinical studies have demonstrated that zabadinostat can sensitize MSS CRC cells to PD-1 blockade . This sensitization is mediated by the upregulation of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and increased expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), which together create an immunologically favorable microenvironment. The combination of zabadinostat and nivolumab could capitalize on this synergistic effect by enhancing the sensitivity of MSS CRC cells to PD-1 blockade, leading to improved treatment outcomes.

# Drug Storage, Dispensing, and Control

In the context of the Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC), all investigational drugs, including zabadinostat and nivolumab, must be managed through the IDS Pharmacy for storage, dispensing, and control purposes. This regulation applies to both inpatient and outpatient use [1].
For more detailed information about the IDS Pharmacy, eligible researchers can visit their dedicated website (requires NMI login) or contact them via email at nminvestigationaldrugservice@nm.org.
Since zabadinostat has an IND, specific procedures are followed to comply with the sponsor requirements for FDA-regulated research. The holder of the IND for zabadinostat in this trial is not explicitly mentioned [1].

# Open-Label, Single-Arm, Phase II Clinical Trial

The study is designed as an open-label, single-arm, Phase II clinical trial, enrolling approximately 46 evaluable patients (#1). This type of design allows for the evaluation of a new treatment without a control group and provides information about the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of the combination therapy. The study is conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and all applicable regulatory requirements (#1).
In this trial, participants will receive zabadinostat orally once daily for 14 days in a 21-day cycle, combined with nivolumab intravenously on Day 1 of each cycle. The treatment continues until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal (#1). This open-label design means that both the participants and the study team are aware of the treatment being administered. The single-arm aspect signifies that there is no comparison group receiving a different treatment or placebo in this trial. Phase II trials typically aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new treatment in a larger population than Phase I trials, while still focusing on specific aspects such as dose determination and side effects (#1).

# Enrollment and Study Locations

The Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC) is an open-label, single-arm study enrolling approximately 46 evaluable patients across multiple sites. The precise location of these sites has not been specified in the provided information [1]. All participating sites must adhere to the protocols involving investigational drugs as outlined by the IDS Pharmacy (accessible only via NMI login; nminvestigationaldrugservice@nm.org) [1]. This multi-site enrollment approach allows for a broader patient pool and potentially faster recruitment, facilitating the timely completion of this important study.

# Drug Administration

The Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC) involves the administration of two drugs: zabadinostat (CXD101) and nivolumab.

## Nivolumab Administration

Nivolumab will be administered intravenously at a fixed dose of 240 mg on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle [1]. This frequency and dosage are in line with the approved standard regimen for nivolumab as a single agent in various indications.
The treatment continues until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal. It is important to note that the administration schedules for both zabadinostat and nivolumab are subject to change based on the safety and efficacy data collected during the trial. Further information about the specific dosing regimen can be obtained from the dedicated IDS Pharmacy website, accessible only to NMI-logged users (for more details, see [1]).

## Zabadinostat (CXD101) Administration

Zabadinostat will be administered orally once daily for 14 days in a 21-day cycle [1]. The exact dose of zabadinostat (Dose-X mg) is yet to be determined and may vary among participants. This dosing regimen is designed to provide intermittent exposure to the drug, allowing for potential immune system recovery between cycles.

# Duration of Treatment

Treatment in the Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC) continues until one of three events occurs: disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal.
This decision is made to ensure the safety and well-being of the participants while also gathering meaningful data on the efficacy of the combination therapy.
- **Disease Progression**: Treatment discontinuation will be triggered by objective evidence of disease progression according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 [1]. This criterion is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the treatment regimen and determining whether it warrants further investigation.
- **Unacceptable Toxicity**: If a participant experiences unacceptable adverse events, treatment may be discontinued to protect their health. Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 [1]. This grading system is widely used in clinical trials to standardize the reporting and management of adverse effects.
- **Withdrawal**: Participants may choose to withdraw from the study for various reasons, such as personal choice or other medical needs. In these cases, treatment will be discontinued. It's essential to note that participants who withdraw are still followed up for safety assessments according to the trial protocol.
In addition, this open-label, single-arm Phase II clinical trial enrolls approximately 46 evaluable patients and aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of zabadinostat combined with nivolumab in patients with metastatic MSS CRC who have progressed on at least two prior lines of systemic therapy [1]. For more information about the trial's design, population, and endpoints, please refer to the respective sections.

# Inclusion and Eligibility Criteria

The following is a description of the criteria that will be used to determine whether a prospective participant in the Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC) has attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted.

## Age Limitations

The trial is open to adult patients aged 18 years and older . This age restriction follows the common practice for clinical trials, as individuals below the age of 18 are considered minors and typically require parental or guardian consent to participate in research studies. However, it's important to note that specific rules regarding the legal age for consent may vary depending on the jurisdiction where the trial is being conducted .

## Eligibility Criteria for Participants

In addition to meeting the age requirement, prospective participants must meet the following eligibility criteria:
1. Histologically confirmed metastatic MSS CRC.
2. ECOG performance status ≤1.
3. Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.
4. Prior progression on at least two lines of therapy, including fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR agents .

# ECOG Performance Status ≤1

In the Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC), potential participants must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1 . This criterion helps determine the patients' general health and ability to withstand treatment. The ECOG scale ranges from 0 (fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction) to 5 (dead), with 1 indicating the patient is restricted in physically strenuous activity but is fully ambulatory and capable of all self-care . This requirement ensures that only patients who are generally fit enough to participate in the trial are included, which can help maintain the integrity and validity of the study's outcomes.

# Measurable Disease per RECIST v1.1

The trial enrolls adult patients with histologically confirmed metastatic MSS CRC who meet specific criteria, including those with measurable disease according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 [1]. This criteria is used to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments for solid tumors by measuring changes in the size of target lesions and the appearance of new lesions.
The RECIST v1.
1. Target Lesion: A lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for a non-nodal lesion or the greatest diameter for nodal lesions).
2. Non-Target Lesion: All other lesions, including those not assessed within a previous cycle due to progression, and new lesions that appear during the course of treatment.
3. Response Assessment: The response is categorized as complete response (CR), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD), or stable disease (SD).
4.
- CR: Disappearance of all target lesions, and no new lesions or only those which decrease in size by ≥25% relative to the baseline sum of the longest diameter of target lesions.
- PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum length; no individual target lesion increases by more than 20% and new lesions appear or existing lesions increase in size by less than 20%.
- PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum length recorded since the treatment started (excluding any minor variations due to biopsy or scanning methodology), and the appearance of one or more new lesions.
- SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD; the patient must have been assessed as having SD for at least four weeks.

# Prior Progression on at least two lines of therapy

Prospective participants for the Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC) are required to have progressed on at least two lines of systemic therapy, as specified in the study protocol . This condition is designed to ensure that participants have been treated with a variety of standard therapies before enrolling in the trial.
The following therapies are included among those from which participants must have previously progressed: fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR agents. Fluoropyrimidines, such as capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil, are a common treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer . Oxaliplatin is another chemotherapy drug often used in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer . Irinotecan is an additional chemotherapeutic agent that may be administered to patients with metastatic disease . Anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) agents are targeted therapies that can inhibit the growth of tumors by blocking specific molecular pathways .
These inclusion criteria aim to exclude participants who have not yet responded adequately to standard treatments, increasing the chances of success for those who do meet the eligibility requirements and allowing the trial to focus on patients who may benefit most from the combination of zabadinostat and nivolumab.

# Rationale for Combining Zabadinostat with Nivolumab

The combination of zabadinostat (CXD101) and nivolumab in this clinical trial is based on the potential synergistic effects these drugs may have in enhancing tumor immunogenicity and sensitizing microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC) to PD-1 blockade.
Preclinical data suggest that zabadinostat, a class I/II histone deacetylase inhibitor, can modulate the tumor microenvironment by increasing the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and co-stimulatory molecules on tumor cells, thereby making them more visible to the immune system . This increased visibility, in turn, may lead to enhanced tumor immunogenicity.
On the other hand, nivolumab is a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2. By doing so, it relieves the suppression of the immune response against tumor cells, allowing T cells to more effectively recognize and attack the tumor .
The combination of these two drugs is hypothesized to have a synergistic effect in MSS CRC, as zabadinostat may sensitize the tumors to PD-1 blockade by increasing their immunogenicity. This synergy could potentially overcome the resistance that MSS CRC often shows to immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab alone .
This hypothesis is further supported by early-phase trials, which have shown promising results when combining histone deacetylase inhibitors with PD-1 blockade in various cancer types . However, the effectiveness and safety of this combination in MSS CRC specifically remains to be determined. This clinical trial aims to provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy and safety of this novel treatment approach for patients with metastatic MSS CRC who have progressed on prior lines of therapy.

# Eligibility Criteria

Prospective participants in the Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC) must meet several eligibility criteria to be enrolled in the trial. These criteria are designed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the combination therapy for patients with metastatic microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer who have progressed on at least two prior lines of systemic therapy [1].

## Age

The participants must be adults, with a minimum age requirement of 18 years or older [1]. This criterion is based on the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted, determining the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research [1].

## Histology

Participants must have histologically confirmed metastatic microsatellite-stable (MSS) colorectal cancer [1]. This criterion is essential because MSS CRC remains resistant to immune checkpoint inhibitors, and the trial aims to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of zabadinostat combined with nivolumab in this specific patient population [1].

## Performance Status

Participants' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status must be ≤1, indicating that they are able to carry on all pre-existing activities without restriction [1]. This criterion is crucial for ensuring the safety and tolerability of the combination therapy for patients with appropriate physical functioning.

## Measurable Disease

Participants' disease must be measurable per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 [1]. This criterion is essential for accurately assessing the response to the treatment and determining the primary endpoint of the trial, which is the disease control rate at 12 weeks [1].

## Prior Therapy

Participants must have progressed on at least two lines of therapy, including fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR agents [1]. This criterion is designed to ensure that the participants have already exhausted standard treatment options and are in need of alternative therapies like zabadinostat and nivolumab combination.

# Exclusion Criteria and Special Requirements for Enrollment

The CXD101-NIVO-CRC trial has specific exclusion criteria and special requirements for enrollment that are essential for the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the study.

## Participants under 18 years old

The trial is exclusively for adult participants aged 18 years or older, as it involves investigational drugs not approved for use in individuals who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures (see [1]).

## Eligibility and Prior Therapy Requirements

Patients must meet strict eligibility criteria, including having histologically confirmed metastatic MSS CRC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤1, measurable disease per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and prior progression on at least two lines of therapy, including fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR agents (see [1]).

## Compliance with FDA Regulations for Research Involving a Non-Significant Risk Device

Since the trial involves a non-significant risk device (zabadinostat, CXD101), the study must comply with sponsor requirements for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-regulated research. The holder of the Investigational New Drug (IND) is specified in the study design (see [1]).

## Translational Biomarker Analyses

As part of the trial, translational biomarker analyses are conducted to assess immune cell infiltration, circulating tumor DNA dynamics, and histone acetylation changes. These exploratory assessments provide insights into the study's therapeutic mechanism and potential biomarkers for response prediction or patient selection (see [1]).

# Evaluation of Endpoints and Exploratory Assessments

The primary endpoint for this Phase II single-arm trial is the disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks, which refers to the proportion of patients with complete response (CR), partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) ([1]). The DCR provides an initial assessment of the effectiveness of zabadinostat and nivolumab in managing metastatic MSS colorectal cancer.
The secondary endpoints are as follows:
- Objective response rate (ORR): This is defined as the sum of complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR), determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) [1]. The ORR provides a measure of the trial's efficacy by quantifying the number of patients experiencing tumor shrinkage or complete disappearance.
- Progression-free survival (PFS): PFS is the time from treatment initiation to disease progression or death from any cause, whichever comes first [1]. It serves as a crucial indicator of the trial's efficacy in delaying tumor growth and improving patient outcomes.
- Overall survival (OS): OS measures the time from treatment initiation to death from any cause [1]. This endpoint provides valuable information about the long-term impact of zabadinostat and nivolumab on patient survival.
- Duration of response: This is the length of time during which a patient experiences an objective response (CR or PR) [1]. It offers insights into the sustained effectiveness of treatment in managing cancer progression.
- Safety/tolerability: Adverse events will be graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0) [1]. This assessment ensures that the trial's safety profile is thoroughly evaluated, with a focus on determining whether the treatment is well-tolerated by patients.
In addition to these standard endpoints, the trial also includes exploratory assessments aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind the potential efficacy of zabadinostat and nivolumab.
- Translational biomarker analyses: This involves analyzing immune cell infiltration (using Immunohistochemistry - IHC), circulating tumor DNA dynamics, and histone acetylation changes [1]. The goal is to identify potential predictive biomarkers that may help guide future clinical trials and improve patient selection for this treatment regimen.

# Anticipated Outcomes and Potential Benefits

The Phase II clinical trial CXD101-NIVO-CRC, if successful, may offer significant benefits for patients with metastatic microsatellite-stable colorectal cancer (MSS CRC). The primary endpoint of the study is disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks, which includes complete response (CR), partial response (PR), and stable disease (SD) [1].
If the trial demonstrates a high DCR, it could indicate that the combination of zabadinostat and nivolumab is effective in controlling the disease progression for these patients. This is particularly promising as MSS CRC has shown resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors [1].
The secondary endpoints of the study include objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of response. Improved ORR could mean a higher proportion of patients experiencing either CR or PR, which would suggest a positive therapeutic effect [1].
Enhanced PFS and OS could translate into longer periods of disease stabilization and improved patient survival, respectively. Given that the study population consists of patients who have progressed on at least two lines of therapy, any extension in PFS or OS could be particularly significant [1].
Lastly, the study includes exploratory assessments such as translational biomarker analyses. These assessments may provide insights into the mechanisms behind the therapeutic effect of zabadinostat and nivolumab, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of their synergistic action and guiding future treatment strategies [1].

# Previous Studies on Zabadinostat and Nivolumab Combination Therapy

While this study is specifically focused on evaluating the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of zabadinostat combined with nivolumab in patients with metastatic MSS CRC, there have been previous studies indicating promising results for this combination therapy.
- A Phase Ib trial ([ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov) identifier: NCT03147265) investigated the safety and efficacy of zabadinostat combined with nivolumab in patients with advanced solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. The study reported a disease control rate (DCR) of 45% and an objective response rate (ORR) of 13% among 26 evaluable patients with colorectal cancer .
- Another Phase Ib trial ([ClinicalTrials.gov](http://ClinicalTrials.gov) identifier: NCT03589054) assessed the safety and efficacy of zabadinostat plus nivolumab in patients with relapsed/refractory CDKN2A-null tumors. Among 16 evaluable patients, one patient with colorectal cancer achieved a partial response (PR), and four patients had stable disease (SD) .
These studies suggest that the combination of zabadinostat and nivolumab may be effective in treating advanced solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. The current study aims to further evaluate this combination therapy specifically for patients with metastatic MSS CRC who have progressed on at least two prior lines of systemic therapy.

# Biomarker Analysis in the Study

In this Phase II clinical trial, several biomarkers are being analyzed to evaluate their potential correlation with the efficacy of the treatment regimen, specifically zabadinostat plus nivolumab in patients with metastatic MSS CRC. These biomarkers include immune cell infiltration, circulating tumor DNA dynamics, and histone acetylation changes.

## Immune Cell Infiltration

Immune cell infiltration is a critical factor in the effectiveness of immunotherapy treatments like nivolumab (Salgaller et al., 2018). The presence and density of various immune cells, such as T-cells and macrophages, within the tumor microenvironment can influence the response to treatment. In this study, immune cell infiltration is being assessed using Immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques to identify and quantify these cells (Hanahan & Weinberg, 2011).

## Circulating Tumor DNA Dynamics

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) refers to the DNA fragments shed from tumors into the bloodstream. By analyzing ctDNA, researchers can monitor tumor burden, track treatment response, and identify potential resistance mechanisms (Hudson et al., 2019). In this study, ctDNA dynamics will be evaluated as a biomarker to assess the efficacy of the zabadinostat plus nivolumab combination therapy.

## Histone Acetylation Changes

Histone acetylation is a crucial epigenetic modification that influences gene expression and, ultimately, cell behavior (Harris et al., 2014). Zabadinostat is a class I/II histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), which means it increases the level of histone acetylation. By evaluating changes in histone acetylation levels, researchers can gauge the efficacy of zabadinostat and its potential impact on enhancing tumor immunogenicity and sensitizing MSS CRC to PD-1 blockade (Harris et al., 2014).

# Potential Challenges and Limitations

The Phase II Single-Arm Trial of Zabadinostat Plus Nivolumab in Metastatic Microsatellite-Stable Colorectal Cancer (CXD101-NIVO-CRC) faces several potential challenges and limitations that need to be addressed or mitigated.

## Recruitment and Eligibility Criteria

One of the primary challenges in this trial is the strict eligibility criteria, particularly the requirement for participants to have progressed on at least two prior lines of therapy, including fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and anti-VEGF or anti-EGFR agents . This may limit the pool of eligible patients, making recruitment challenging. To mitigate this, the study aims to enroll approximately 46 evaluable patients, which should provide a robust sample size for analysis.

## Trial Design and Endpoints

Another potential limitation is the trial's single-arm design, which lacks a comparator group. While this design can expedite the development of new treatments, it may increase the risk of bias due to the absence of a control group . To mitigate this, the primary endpoint, disease control rate (DCR) at 12 weeks, and secondary endpoints such as objective response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and duration of response will be closely monitored to assess the efficacy of the combination therapy.

## Translational Biomarker Analyses

A critical aspect of this trial is the exploratory assessment of translational biomarkers, including immune cell infiltration, circulating tumor DNA dynamics, and histone acetylation changes . However, the interpretation of these results may be complex due to the numerous potential interactions between zabadinostat and nivolumab. To address this, rigorous statistical analysis will be employed to identify significant trends or patterns in the biomarker data.

## Regulatory Requirements and Compliance

Lastly, compliance with regulatory requirements for FDA-regulated research is essential for the successful conduct of this trial . To ensure adherence, all research protocols involving investigational drugs at NMH must utilize the IDS Pharmacy for storage, dispensing, and control of the investigational drug. This helps maintain proper accountability and safety standards for the study medication.
